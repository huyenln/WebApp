			Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, <br>
			And sorry I could not travel both <br>
			And be one traveler, long I stood <br>
			And looked down one as far as I could <br>
			To where it bent in the undergrowth; <br>

			Then took the oter, as just as fair, <br>
			And having perhaps the better claim <br>
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear; <br>
			Though as for that the passing there <br>
			Had worn them really about the same, <br>

			And both that morning equally lay <br>
			In leaves no step had trodden black <br>
			Oh, I kept the first for another day! <br>
			Yet knowing how way leads on to way, <br>
			I doubted if I should ever come back <br>

			And that has made all the difference <br>
			I shal be telling this with a sigh <br>
			Somewhere ages and ages hence: <br>
			Two roads diverged in a wood, and <br>
			I took the one less traveled by. <br>
